Welcome to your firewall installation script for IPS Masternode.

I will download the firewall rules for you, then install the firewall.
You will be asked if you want the firewall to be started at boot time:
${RED}answer "no"${NC}

I insist:
${RED} _______________
/   Answer no   \\
\\_______________/${NC}
Otherwise your masternode would get disconnected and you would have to
wait rewards as if you had restarted your masternode.
You definitely don't want this...

No worry I will make your firewall start at boot time later.


Also don't try to login more than 5 times in a 2 minutes row to your vps,
you would be locked out for a short period of time.
If you do however just be patient, you should be able to connect again in
a few minutes...

And now for something totally different!

Hit <return> and enjoy!
